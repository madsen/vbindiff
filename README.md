VBinDiff - Visual Binary Diff
=============================

[Visual Binary Diff (VBinDiff)](http://www.cjmweb.net/vbindiff/) displays files in hexadecimal and ASCII (or EBCDIC).  It can also display two files at once, and highlight the differences between them.  Unlike diff, it works well with large files (up to 64 GB).

VBinDiff was inspired by the Compare Files function of the [ProSel utilities by Glen Bredon](http://www.apple2.org.za/gswv/USA2WUG/Glen.Bredon.In.Memoriam/A2.Software/), for the [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II).  When I couldn't find a similar utility for the PC, I wrote it myself.

The single-file mode was inspired by the LIST utility of [4DOS and friends](http://jpsoft.com/take-command-windows-scripting.html).  While [less](http://www.greenwoodsoftware.com/less/) provides a good line-oriented display, it has no equivalent to LIST's hex display.  (True, you can pipe the file through [hexdump](http://linux.die.net/man/1/hexdump), but that's incredibly inefficient on multi-gigabyte files.)


Working with This Repository
----------------------------

This repository uses a submodule to pull in my [Free GetOpt](https://github.com/madsen/free-getopt) package, which makes it a bit trickier to get started with than the average Git repository.  Here's how to get started.

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it.
2. Run `git submodule update --init`
3. If you're working on a Unix system, run `autoreconf -i`

Now you're ready to use the normal `./configure && make` process on Unix, or open `win32/vbindiff.dsw` on Windows.

To build the documentation, you'll also need [Perl](http://www.perl.org/), [Date::Format](https://metacpan.org/module/Date::Format), and [Template-Toolkit](https://metacpan.org/release/Template-Toolkit).  For Windows, I recommend [Strawberry Perl](http://strawberryperl.com/), which comes with the necessary modules.  On Unix, your distro may have packages, or you can install from [CPAN](http://www.cpan.org/).  Package names for some distros are:

* [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/): `perl perl-template-toolkit perl-timedate`
* [Gentoo Linux](http://www.gentoo.org/): `dev-lang/perl dev-perl/Template-Toolkit dev-perl/TimeDate`
* [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/): `perl libtemplate-perl libtimedate-perl`

If you're developing on Unix, I suggest you also `cp -a tools/post-commit .git/hooks/`.  That hook will touch `configure.ac` after each commit that modifies it, causing `configure` to be regenerated and making `AC_REVISION` reflect the new commit.
